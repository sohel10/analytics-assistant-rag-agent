TITLE: Visit Cadence & Windows (Illustrative)

PURPOSE
- Define standard visit schedule, allowable windows, and required assessments.

STANDARD SCHEDULE & WINDOWS
- Screening: Day −28 to Day −1 (window ±0)
- Baseline/Day 1: Day 1 (±0)
- Week 2: Day 14 (±3 days)
- Week 4: Day 28 (±7 days)
- Then Every 4 Weeks: q4w from Day 28 (±7 days)
- End of Treatment (EOT): within 7 days after last dose
- Safety Follow-up: 30 (±7) days after EOT

REQUIRED PROCEDURES (BY VISIT TYPE)
- All On-Treatment Visits (incl. Week 2, Week 4, q4w):
  • Vitals, weight, ECOG/PS
  • Concomitant medications (ConMeds) update
  • Adverse Events (AE/SAE) review since prior visit
  • Investigational product (IP) accountability & dosing review
  • Labs: CBC with diff, CMP (or as per protocol)
  • ECG if clinically indicated or per protocol schedule
  • PROs/QoL questionnaires per schedule
- Baseline/Day 1 add:
  • Inclusion/Exclusion confirmation, randomization
  • Baseline disease assessments/imaging (if applicable)
- EOT:
  • AE/SAE review, labs (CBC/CMP), IP reconciliation, disposition
- Safety Follow-up:
  • AE/SAE since EOT, concomitant meds, any new procedures

MISSED / OUT-OF-WINDOW HANDLING
- Schedule the visit at the earliest feasible date.
- Document protocol deviation and rationale in source/EDC.
- Obtain safety labs remotely if participant cannot attend (if allowed).
- PI to assess impact on safety/efficacy endpoints.

TELEVISIT ALLOWANCE
- Televisit may be used for wellness/QoL and AE checks if no IP change or procedures requiring in-person collection.
- No IP dispensing by mail unless explicitly permitted by protocol/regulator.

VISIT DATE LOGIC (HELPER)
- Next due date ≈ prior in-person visit date + 28 days (q4w), respect ±7-day window.
- If date falls on holiday/closure, shift within the allowed window.
